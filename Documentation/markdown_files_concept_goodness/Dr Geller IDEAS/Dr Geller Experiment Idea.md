We can formulate one experiment with human experts as follows:

The question will be:
Would this be a good concept for an SDoH ontology?

And then we include some concepts that are ALREADY in the SDoH ontology and some new ones.

Of course, this is a redirect as we did not prefilter the UMLS for SDoH at all. So this is a bit more in the future or a different direction.

Right now, I was thinking more generally, as in:

Would this be a good concept for a MEDICAL ontology?

Or (I am running wild now) we could choose two ontologies from the UMLS in different areas and then pick random concepts from each but only ask the subjects about one ontology.

Say, choose the SDoH ontology and the Diseases Ontology.
Then ask them if this is a good concept FOR (not FROM) the SDoH ontology. If they pick few from the Disease Ontology, this is progress.

To be discussed and thought about more....
