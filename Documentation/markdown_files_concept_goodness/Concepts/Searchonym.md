Frequency of occurrence outside the vicinity

Strength of a term idiom:
- Meaning is different than the words inside it
- Example: "hardwired" - meaning of hardwired is beyond "hard" and "wired"
- Example: "break a leg"

Frequency not enough:
- Examples: "of which", "at that"

Context in terms of different types of neighbors:
- Term with lots of different neighbors and anything sticks out, then compute more and got a score
- Interesting words are not necessarily the ones that appear more frequently

Examples:
- "Once upon a" -> does not make sense/relevance
- Attraction factor is high but it is not relevant.
