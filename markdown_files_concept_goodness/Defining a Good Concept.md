1. **Language Generation Cognitive Viewpoint:**
   - If you are likely to use this concept, it is probably better than otherwise.

2. **Language Understanding Cognitive Viewpoint:**
   - a) If you read this concept and it does not slow you down, it is probably better than otherwise.
   - b) If you have heard that concept "recently" used, it is probably better than otherwise. *(Speech understanding + community language use)*

3. **Extensional Definition:**
   - If you believe that there are lots of things in the real world that are described by this concept, it is probably better than otherwise. *(Real world does not have to mean "material" it can be abstract).*

4. **Legalistic:**
   - Can this concept make a difference in a legal setting? If yes, it is better than otherwise. Example: Murder and manslaughter are two concepts that describe one person ending the life of another person. But in a legal context, the punishment for murder could be the death penalty, but not for manslaughter.
